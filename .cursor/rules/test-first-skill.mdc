applyTo: *

Before implementing any bug fix, feature, or behavior change, load and follow `.cursor/skills/test-first-development/SKILL.md`.

Execution order is mandatory:
1. Write or update tests first.
2. Run tests and confirm failure for the intended reason.
3. Implement the minimal production change.
4. Re-run tests and confirm pass.

Only skip this flow if the user explicitly instructs to bypass tests.
